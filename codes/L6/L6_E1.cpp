Example :            Example - 1 
Problem Statement :  Find out the daily price of a car under certain conditions
                     i) Car type = Standard, Member = Yes, Price = 55 
                     ii) Car type = Standard, Member = No, Price = 55
                     iii) Car type = Luxury, Member = Yes, Price = 75
                     iv) Car type = Luxury, Member = No, Price = 85

/**
Pseudocode:

1. Take car type and membership info as user input
2. Check the condition
3. Display the daily fee for different combinations of car type and membership

Algorithm:

1. Declare variable : dailyFee = 55, carType, memberStatus
2. User input : carType. memberStatus
3. Check : if (carType == Luxury)
        - Challenge: To write the condition we have to change the lettercase for carType
        - Challenge: To change the lettercase we have to create our custom function
        - Challenge: We will use for loop to iterate through the variable
        - Challenge: We will use Reference and Pointer concept to create the function
    4. Check : if (membership == yes)
        5. Add $20 with dailyFee
            - Tips : Use Arithmetic Assignment Variable
    6. else
        7. Add $30 with dailyFee
8. Display the daily fee for the car
